# Conan package for yandex/ozo

This is a very simple conan package script to upload [yandex/ozo](https://github.com/yandex/ozo) to conan artifactory of your choice.
It doesn't run unit tests before packaging and uses ozo version from master. Dependecies from contrib are packed together with the lib for simplicity.
